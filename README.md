# 🏦 CreditWise – AI Credit Risk Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be **Approved** or **Rejected** using an **XGBoost Classifier**.

The project follows a production-style architecture with a **Streamlit frontend**, **FastAPI backend**, and **XGBoost model** deployed separately.
